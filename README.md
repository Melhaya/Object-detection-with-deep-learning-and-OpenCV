# Object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-OpenCV
Using MobileNet Single Shot Detector to detet multiple object in Images.

The MobileNet SSD was first trained on the COCO dataset and was then fine-tuned on PASCAL VOC reaching 72.7% mAP (mean average precision).  

To start the code, Write this command in the promt: python Object_detection_images.py --prototxt MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt.txt --model MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel --image path/to/images/directory
